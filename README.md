PROJECT ABSTARCT:
The development of an advanced attendance marking system integrates voice recognition, speech-to-text summarization, and face recognition technologies. This system transcribes spoken words into text using voice recognition, condenses the transcribed text into concise summaries through speech-to-text summarization algorithms, and employs face recognition for accurate identification of individuals. The system aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of attendance recording processes while providing a user-friendly interface for both administrators and end-users. It ensures robust data security and compliance with privacy regulations, optimizes performance and scalability to accommodate varying user loads, and undergoes comprehensive testing to evaluate its accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to offer a reliable and secure solution for attendance marking in educational and organizational settings, contributing to the advancement of attendance systems through the integration of innovative technologies
